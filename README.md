# directory.tree

This is a test project, developed to assess capabilities. It took me 3 days to complete it, so please excuse the code; it could have been better, and there are many areas for improvement. 
However, I believe that for an assessment of capabilities, everything is clearly presented.

Built using pure PHP with Bootstrap, jQuery, and Awesome Font.

I'm looking for ambitious projects that will allow me to self-improve and grow. I'm open to productive and promising collaborations.
